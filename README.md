# Hardly's End Structures V2

(Description copied from Planet Minecraft post)

Introducing Hardly's End Structures V2! A revisited version of my datapack which overhauls the vanilla end cities appearance and adds new floating 'End Islands' with loot, enemies and traps! This 2nd version completes the pack, more than doubling the number of End Islands as well as adding the 'End Leviathans'! large dungeon like structures which you can now find. This update also adds some Nullscape specific structures, I highly recommend you download the full Nullscape version and use the Nullscape datapack for a complete overhauled end experience. However a vanilla version is also available.

## Installation

The full datapack and a version without Nullscape structures can be downloaded from [the Planet Minecraft post](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/hes-hardly-s-end-structures/)

Note that the [Nullscape datapack](https://www.stardustlabs.net/datapacks#Nullscape) by Stardust Labs is required for the full datapack to function.
